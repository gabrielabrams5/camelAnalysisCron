# Required Assets

This directory needs the following image files for the placard infographic to display correctly:

## Required Files

1. **`camel-logo.png`**
   - The Camel logo displayed in the header (left side)
   - Recommended size: ~150-200px height
   - Should have transparent background

2. **`final-thumbnail.png`**
   - Event thumbnail/flyer displayed in the header (right side)
   - Recommended size: max width ~173px
   - Will be displayed with rounded corners

## Current Status

- [ ] camel-logo.png (place your logo file here)
- [ ] final-thumbnail.png (place your event thumbnail here)

## Notes

- These files are referenced in `src/App.tsx`
- Without these files, the infographic will show broken image placeholders
- The files should be placed directly in this `public/` directory
- After adding the files, rebuild the React app with `npm run build`
